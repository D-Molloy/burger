# Eat-Da-Burger

**Eat-Da-Burger** is a full-stack site that allows users to eat, make, or create burgers.  The site utilizes node.js, express.js, and a MySQL database to store and deliver data.  Handlebars.js (new technology for the week) is used to template the HTML pages.

* burger.js - handles the button click events that update the DB and html
* main.handlebars/index.handlebars - the handlebars templates for the html page
* style.css - custom stylings
